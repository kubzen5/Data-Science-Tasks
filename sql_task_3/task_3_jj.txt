Description: A case where we only want to get columns from the students table.
From the description of the assignment, I've concluded that it's only about data from student.
If I want to add data from another tables, I would use for example er.* etc. depends on tables.

SELECT s.* FROM students AS s
JOIN exam_results AS er ON s.student_id=er.student_id 
JOIN class_catalogue as cc ON er.class_id=cc.class_id
WHERE er.grade>=4 and cc.class_name='algebra';
